Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 Software engineering is the designing, building, testing and maintaining of software. 
 Software engineering is important since;
  (a)Development of robust systems which minimise errors and improve user friendliness
  (b)Development of systems which are able to meet increasing demand for funtional systems and adapt to future developments
  (c)Gives birth to inovations since companies are able to easily come up with solutions to problems facing their companies and the world at large 
  (d)Enhances user security from cyber threats  

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 (a)Introduction of high level languages in the 1950s and 1960s-This enabled developers to write codes close to human rather than machine language
 (b)personal computer revolution in the 1970s and 1980s-It made computing more accessible to individuals, businesses, workplaces and even schools giving rise to the information age
 (c)Mobile apps in the 2000s-This enabled users to shop, access finances and do many more on the go

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 Phase one- PLANNING- Gathering and putting together requirement of the customer
 Phase two- DESIGN- Creation of a blueprint including databases, system interfaces and  interfaces
 Phase three- TESTING- Running of the software checking if it meets the customer's requirements
 Phase four- DEPLOYMENT- This is the enrollment of the software into the operational environment where it is going to be used by the customer 
 Phase five- MAINTAINANCE- this is regular updates and working on developing issues if any arises 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  DIFFERENCES
 (a)Agile prioritizes adaptability and readily incorporates changes as the project progresses, whereas Waterfall adheres to a rigid plan with limited room for adjustments once a phase 
     is complete.
  (b)In Agile, requirements are gathered iteratively and refined throughout the project, while in Waterfall, requirements are expected to be fully defined upfront before development 
     begins.
  (c)Agile delivers working software in small increments (sprints) with regular feedback loops, while Waterfall delivers the final product at the end of the development cycle. 
  (d)Agile encourages high customer engagement and collaboration throughout the project, while Waterfall typically involves less customer interaction until the final product is 
     delivered. 
  SIMILARITIES
   (a)Both methodologies focus on achieving project goals and delivering a functional product that satisfies customer requirements. 
   (b)Both involve distinct phases like planning, design, development, testing, and deployment, although the order and execution of these phases differ. 
   (c)Both methodologies necessitate gathering and understanding project requirements, even if the level of detail differs.
   (d)Both emphasize quality assurance through testing and feedback loops to identify and address issues. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
 SOFTWARE DEVELOPER
  -Define the characteristics of the software, including the software architecture
  -Build the software, including the back-end databases and user interface
  -Run the software through multiple scenarios to identify bugs, errors, or performance issues
  -Fix bugs by debugging the code
  -Keep the software functional, usable, and high-performing
 QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER
  -Execute test cases according to the test plan, logging and tracking identified defects using bug tracking tools
  -Develop comprehensive test plans outlining testing strategies, scope, and expected outcomes based on product requirements. 
  -Monitor and analyze test results to identify trends and potential quality issues. 
  -Effectively communicate testing status, findings, and risks to stakeholders, including project managers and clients.
 PROJECT MANAGER
  -Defining project goals and objectives 
  -Establishing project scope and requirements
  -Assembling and managing the development team 
  -Delegating tasks and responsibilities 
  
  Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
   IDE- helps programmers develop software code efficiently
   VCS- keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code 
        to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.
 
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 -Debugging complex code
 -Keeping up with technology
 -Managing burnout

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
